# CS-210-Portfolio-Submission
Module eight portfolio project for CS-210 at SNHU

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is a simple login system implemented in C++. This login system allows users to persist data in local storage between subsequent executions of the program.

What did you do particularly well?
I commented the code well so it is easy for people to check out the code and understand what it does without knowing all of the little implementation details. It will also be easier for me to come back after I've forgotted how everything is implemented and work on the project with ease. I also utilized a user class such that adding additional functionality will be much easier.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could modularize the program better. I could break up some of the functions into different files so that the main file will not be so cluttered and so that it's easier to find which function you'd like to work on, as well as test individual functions easier.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Sometimes C++ gives some unhelpful errors and it's difficult to see what's happening. Learning to utilize the debugger and set breakpoints in multiple places that may be the culprit is one of the most useful tools I've learned to use in this course. Manipulating strings in C++ always gives me some problems, so those points were the most challenging for me. The debugger will stay a useful tool in my support network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Utilizing object-oriented programming will be extremely transferable to many other projects and course work that I do in the future. Utilizing the debugger will also transfer to any program that I write. Learning what the standard library has to offer will be useful whenever I would like to use C++. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Object-oriented programming will be useful in many future projects and course work. I began to design this project without objects in mind, and quickly found out that it would be much easier to add a user class, and that it would make the program much more adaptable. It also makes the program more maintainable and readable, because it is separated and organized into multiple files and classes.
